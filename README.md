# Benchmarking UIKit App: A UIKit Implementation
This repository holds the codebase for the UIKit version of the apps that were designed and developed during my Master's thesis project for the purpose of benchmarking UI frameworks in iOS. The comprehensive research report can be accessed from this link [Diva link to be updated soon].

# Execution Guide
Running the code is a straightforward process. Simply clone the project and open it in XCode. From there, you can run it on your device or simulator as per your preference.

# Data Archive
The data gathered from the execution of this project can be located in the '[data](https://github.com/benjaminronneling/UIKitBenchmarkApp/tree/main/data)' directory. In the same directory, you'll also find a combined version of data where the data from the UIKit version is merged with the data from the SwiftUI version of the app.

# SwiftUI App Equivalent
An equivalent app has also been built using SwiftUI for comparative purposes. You can find the SwiftUI version of the app [here](https://github.com/benjaminronneling/SwiftUIBenchmarkApp).
